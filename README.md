# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to create a comprehensive fitness application that plans and provides advice on workout plans, diet, and food preparation. It will integrate with various platforms such as Cronometer, the USDA Food Database, Foodstruct.com, and AppleWatch Fitness to offer users a better fitness experience.

## Background

The project addresses several problems related to fitness applications, including the lack of personalized workout and diet plans, limited food databases, and disjointed user experiences. These issues are quite common, as many existing applications fail to provide a holistic and tailored approach to fitness. My personal motivation stems from the desire to improve the overall fitness experience and help users achieve their health goals more effectively.

## How is it used?

Users can utilize the application to receive customized workout plans, personalized diet recommendations, and guidance on food preparation. The solution is needed in various situations, including home workouts, gym sessions, and meal planning at home or on the go. The users may have different needs, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or overall health improvement, which should be taken into account during the planning process.

## Data sources and AI methods

The application will gather data from multiple sources. It will integrate with Cronometer to access users' nutritional information and track their food intake. The USDA Food Database and Foodstruct.com will provide comprehensive food data for accurate diet planning. Additionally, the application will utilize AI methods to analyze users' fitness goals, dietary requirements, and performance data to generate tailored workout plans and nutritional recommendations.

## Challenges

While the project aims to offer a better fitness application, it does not solve all fitness-related problems. Limitations include the accuracy of the integrated data sources, the challenge of accommodating individual preferences and dietary restrictions, and the reliance on user-reported data. Ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying the solution, such as ensuring data privacy and providing scientifically validated advice.

## What next?

The project has the potential to expand and become more comprehensive. Further development could include features like real-time workout tracking, meal tracking, and social integration for users to connect and support each other. To move forward, additional skills in data analysis, machine learning, and user experience design would be beneficial. Collaboration with nutritionists, fitness trainers, and health professionals could provide valuable expertise for enhancing the application's effectiveness.
